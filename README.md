# Advent Calendar 2025: Jetpack Compose Christmas Challenge

Hosted by [androidDevNews](https://github.com/AndroidDevNews) 🎄

This repo showcases my participation in the **Advent Calendar 2025 Compose Christmas Challenge**, where I built a complete animated Christmas tree scene using Jetpack Compose and Canvas — one layer at a time, from Day 1 to Day 24.

Instead of uploading every screenshot and video here, I shared daily progress updates, animations, and final reveals directly on X (Twitter) as I went along.

### Check out the full journey on X:

You can find screenshots, short video clips of animations (twinkling lights, falling snow, pulsing star, etc.), and the grand finale video from Day 24.

### Special Thanks 🫶🏼

A huge thank you to the [@AndroidDev_News](https://x.com/AndroidDev_News) for creating and hosting this fantastic challenge!  
It was an incredible way to dive deep into Canvas drawing, animations, interactions, and Compose best practices while getting into the holiday spirit. Your creative prompts and support made it truly special. 🎅✨

Happy Holidays and happy coding!
